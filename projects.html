                <p class="card-text" id="t1">I led a team of four in creating a web application that addresses
                    sustainability and
                    social good. Our goal was to help individuals in need easily locate the nearest food
                    bank that best meets their needs. We utilized HTML and CSS for the front-end development
                    and Python Flask for the back-end, incorporating Google APIs to enhance functionality.
                    Despite the tight 24-hour deadline, our team was able to design, develop, and present a
                    fully functional web application.

                    program
                    determines the most relevant files on your computer based on your query and presents them in
                    a
                    browser-like structure, with the top result being the most relevant. Written in Python, this
                    search engine is a great tool for anyone looking to efficiently find information they need.
